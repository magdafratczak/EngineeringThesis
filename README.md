# EngineeringThesis - backed of application  

**Application created for the purposes of final engineering project.**  
 The goal of the project is to deliver a product that improves the daily work of personal trainers by providing a platform for communication between trainers and trainees. Potential clients will be able to establish collaboration with a personal trainer of their choice based on their own preferences. Users should have the ability to view statistics of their own workouts, while trainers can track the progress of their trainees. The user interface is in English. The final application will run in the Amazon Web Services cloud environment.The current version of the application provides basic functionalities for user management, scheduling workouts, creating training plans and tracking the progress of trainees.   
 **The work was written by a four-person team and originally developed in a shared repository. This repository, however, contains the code for the backend part of the application, of which I am the author.**
